# ðŸ¥ž Pancake vs Waffle Classifier ðŸ§‡

A Python web application that uses computer vision to classify images as either pancakes or waffles.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload your own images for classification
- **Sample Images**: Test with pre-loaded pancake and waffle images
- **Computer Vision Analysis**: Uses OpenCV for edge detection and pattern recognition
- **Real-time Results**: Instant classification with confidence scores
- **Web Interface**: Clean, responsive web interface built with Flask

## How It Works

The classifier analyzes images using several computer vision techniques:

1. **Edge Detection**: Uses Canny edge detection to find patterns
2. **Grid Pattern Recognition**: Detects waffle grid patterns using Hough line detection
3. **Shape Analysis**: Analyzes aspect ratios to identify circular vs rectangular shapes
4. **Color Variation**: Examines color diversity (useful for detecting syrup/toppings)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suttonarribas-bot/Pancake-Waffle.git
   cd Pancake-Waffle
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add sample images**:
   - Create a `static/images/` directory
   - Add your pancake and waffle sample images to this directory
   - Name them according to the sample mapping in `app.py`

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Start classifying images!

## File Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # This file

```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main web interface
- `POST /classify` - Classify uploaded image
- `GET /classify_sample/<sample_name>` - Classify sample image
- `GET /static/images/<filename>` - Serve static images

## Classification Rules

The classifier uses the following rules to distinguish pancakes from waffles:

1. **Grid Pattern Detection** (Waffle characteristic)
   - Uses Hough line detection to find grid patterns
   - High confidence for waffles

2. **Edge Density Analysis** (Waffle characteristic)
   - High edge density suggests waffle structure
   - Canny edge detection used

3. **Shape Analysis** (Pancake characteristic)
   - Circular shapes suggest pancakes
   - Rectangular shapes suggest waffles

4. **Color Variation** (Waffle characteristic)
   - High color variation suggests waffles with toppings/syrup

## Sample Images

The application includes sample images for testing:
- 5 Pancake examples
- 5 Waffle examples

## Dependencies

- **Flask**: Web framework
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library
- **Pillow**: Image processing
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing

## Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
python app.py
```

### Production Deployment
For production deployment, consider using:
- **Gunicorn** as WSGI server
- **Nginx** as reverse proxy
- **Docker** for containerization

Example with Gunicorn:
```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Images not loading**: Ensure sample images are in `static/images/` directory
2. **Upload errors**: Check file size limits and supported formats
3. **Classification errors**: Verify OpenCV installation

### Debug Mode

Run with debug mode for detailed error messages:
```bash
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
python app.py
```
